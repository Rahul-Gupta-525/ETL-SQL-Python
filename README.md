# ETL Project

This project demonstrates an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Python and SQL. The primary objective was to clean and transform raw datasets and load the cleaned data into a SQL database for further analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Datasets**:
   - The project involves four datasets: `customer`, `orders`, `products`, and `payments`.

2. **Extract**:
   - Loaded the datasets into a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and cleaning.

3. **Transform**:
   - Performed data cleaning and transformation using Python libraries such as `pandas`.

4. **Load**:
   - Established a connection to a SQL database using `SQLAlchemy`.
   - Loaded the cleaned datasets into SQL Workbench.

5. **Query and Analysis**:
   - Retrieved SQL queries back into Python for analysis and visualization.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**:
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `mysql.connector`
- **SQL**:
  - SQL Workbench for database management
- **Jupyter Notebook**:
  - Environment for data cleaning and analysis

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. Load the datasets into the Jupyter Notebook.

4. Follow the steps in the notebook for cleaning and transforming the data.

5. Use `SQLAlchemy` to connect to a SQL database and load the cleaned data.

6. Perform SQL queries in SQL Workbench and retrieve results in Python for analysis.

## Results

- Successfully cleaned and transformed the data.
- Loaded the data into SQL Workbench.
- Retrieved SQL outputs into Python for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Automate the entire ETL pipeline.
- Integrate visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.
- Handle larger datasets using distributed systems.
